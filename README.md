# Detection-Lab
# Detection Lab

## 🎯 Objective

The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience deepened my understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

## 🧠 Skills Learned

- Applied SIEM concepts through hands-on log ingestion and correlation.
- Analyzed and interpreted real-time network and host-based logs.
- Recognized attack signatures using detection tools like Suricata and Zeek.
- Strengthened understanding of network protocols and common vulnerabilities.
- Developed cybersecurity problem-solving and incident triage skills.

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **SIEM**: Splunk, Elastic Stack
- **Network Analysis**: Wireshark, Zeek
- **Telemetry Generation**: Atomic Red Team, Invoke-Atomic, Caldera
- **Other Tools**: VirtualBox, Windows Server, Ubuntu, Sysmon, MITRE ATT&CK
